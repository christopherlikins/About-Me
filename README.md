# About Me

Fresh off of finishing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development where I completed 23 college courses in less than six months I am now aggressively job hunting exclusively in Denmark. To keep my skills sharp, I am going to build a mobile app in C# and then eventually create a web app in REACT after I learn how to build a GraphQL api for the SQL database I am designing. I am calling it The Library Steps. I want an application where I can keep track of and recommend galleries, museums, and cultural sites as a way to find new places to explore and get exposure for smaller facilities that may get less exposure.

I just finished deployment of the online presence for Coyote and Crow LLC where I planned, styled, and implemented a solution that includes WordPress, MediaWiki, PHPBB, Shopify, and a name generator in the Chahi language that uses a Markov Algorithm and principals of natural language generation to create new words that follow the phonetic structures of the language.
