The Initial Endeavor and Colation


Stay at home dad frontloading a career. In a few years my kids will be school aged and I would like to be prepared to begin my career. I will be able to do what I love, and never stop learning. It has been a long road back, but I could not be more excited to be writing code and continuing the journey that began with an HTML book in 7th grade.
