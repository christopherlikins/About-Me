The Initial Endeavor and Colation


Fresh off of finishing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development where I completed 23 college courses in less than six months I am now agressivly job hunting exclusively in Denmark. To keep my skills sharp I am going to build a mobile app in C# and then eventually create a web app in REACT. I am calling it The Library Steps. I want an application where I can keep track of and recomend galleries, museums, and cultural sites as a way to find new places to explore and get exposure for smaller facilities that may get less exposure.
